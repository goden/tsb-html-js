        <p>Pseudo-classes match elements based on certain states.</p>
        <p>
            For example, the a (anchor) element can have the
            following four states: link, visited, hover, and active
        </p>

            “first-child” pseudo-class. This pseudo-class does match elements
            based on their position in the element tree, but is still considered a pseudo-class because the fact that an
            element is the first child of its parent is considered an arbitrary state.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first-child pseudo-class is usually
            combined with a tag or class selector
